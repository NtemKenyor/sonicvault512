# Testing Guide for SonicVault512

## Overview
SonicVault512 simplifies testing by allowing users to switch between different networks using URL parameters. The default network is **Mainnet**, but users can switch to **Testnet (Devnet)** or even a **local server** for testing purposes.

---

## Testing Different Networks

### 1. **Mainnet (Default)**
By default, the project loads on the **Mainnet of Sonic SVM**.

- **Localhost:**  
  ```
  http://localhost/sonicvault512/frontend/yield.html
  ```
- **Live Server:**  
  ```
  https://roynek.com/sonicvault512/frontend/
  ```

### 2. **Testnet (Devnet)**
To test on the **Testnet**, add the `network=devnet` parameter to the URL.

- **Localhost:**  
  ```
  http://localhost/sonicvault512/frontend/yield.html?network=devnet
  ```
- **Live Server:**  
  ```
  https://roynek.com/sonicvault512/frontend/?network=devnet
  ```

### 3. **Local Server with Testnet**
For testing on a **local server** while connected to the **Testnet**, use the `server=local` parameter.

- **Localhost:**  
  ```
  http://localhost/sonicvault512/frontend/yield.html?network=devnet&server=local
  ```

## How to Test
1. **Ensure you have a wallet connected** (or create one using the in-built wallet generator).
2. **Check the UI behavior and functionalities** such as:
   - Wallet creation and loading
   - Balance retrieval
   - Transaction execution
3. **Switch between networks using the appropriate URLs** to verify that data loads correctly for each environment.
4. **Test Edge Cases**:
   - Try refreshing after switching networks
   - Test on different browsers and devices
   - Simulate slow network conditions

---

## Additional Notes
- If you encounter errors, check the console (`F12` â†’ Console Tab) for logs.
- The network parameter must be correctly formatted (`devnet`, `mainnet`).
- The local server must be properly set up to serve the files.

For further debugging, reach out to the project maintainers.

Happy Testing!
